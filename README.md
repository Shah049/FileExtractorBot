# üìÑ DocuChat: Chat with Your Documents & Links ü§ñ

DocuChat is an interactive Streamlit application that allows you to have a conversation with your documents. Upload a file (`PDF`, `DOCX`, `TXT`, `XLSX`, images) or provide a web link, and the app will use a powerful Large Language Model (LLaMA 3 via Groq) to answer your questions about the content.

## ‚ú® Features

-   **Multi-Format Support**: Upload various file types, including PDF, TXT, DOCX, Excel spreadsheets, and even images (PNG, JPG) for OCR.
-   **Web Content Ingestion**: Paste a URL to chat with the content of a webpage.
-   **Powered by LLaMA 3 & Groq**: Leverages the speed and power of the LLaMA 3 model running on the Groq LPU‚Ñ¢ Inference Engine for real-time responses.
-   **Adjustable Persona**: Change the explanation style of the chatbot to suit a "Child," "Young Person," or "Adult."
-   **Content Dashboard**: After processing a document, view a dashboard with a concise summary, key topics, word count, and estimated reading time.
-   **Secure API Key Handling**: Uses Streamlit's built-in secrets management for safe API key storage.
-   **Modern UI**: A clean, styled, and intuitive user interface built with Streamlit.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

-   Python 3.8+
-   A [Groq Cloud API Key](https://console.groq.com/keys)

### Local Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <your-repository-folder>
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set up your API key:**
    -   Create a folder in your project's root directory named `.streamlit`.
    -   Inside that folder, create a file named `secrets.toml`.
    -   Add your Groq API key to this file as follows:
        ```toml
        GROQ_API_KEY = "your_groq_api_key_here"
        ```

5.  **Run the Streamlit application:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud
